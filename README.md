# fast-ai
Implementations for the fast.ai (http://course.fast.ai/) course.

**sequence-learning**: Implemented a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture in Pytorch to identify MNIST sequences. The architecture used is comes from the Show-and-Tell paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555).

**statefarm**: Finetuned VGG-16 with Keras to identify distracted drivers in dash cam images. The data comes from this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection.
